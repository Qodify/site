    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to one of my creative outlets. This site is developed and maintained
      by me. Though right now it's under heavy construction. Not only does this
      site function as a creative outlet, it's also a showcase of my digital
      talents. I know, I know. Everyone and their dog has a website. but not
      always without "wordpress" in the name,or developed with a modern framework
      like Svelte, which loads in my blogposts by an api written in ASP.NET Core
      (with CD thanks to Github Actions) which retrieves them from a remote azure
      database...
    </p>
    <p>You get the point.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      So you will probably find IT related posts here, but also other topics. That
      is, if I find I'm finally done writing the website.
